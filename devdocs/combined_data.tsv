GSE10797	Burlington, VT, USA	University of Vermont	Public on Apr 03 2008	Dec 06 2018	Breast tissue was collected at surgery from patients undergoing surgical resection for  invasive breast cancer (n=28) and reduction mammoplasty (n=5).  Tissue was cryopreserved in OCT and serial sections were cut using a cryostat.  Sections were stained and epithelial and stromal cells were isolated by laser capture microdissection.  Total RNA was isolated and target was prepared using NuGen Ribo-SPIA Ovation Technology.  Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 GeneChips. Gene expression differences were evaluated using a linear model of the Robust Multichip Average gene expression statistic, a model that accounted for cell type (E and S), patient diagnosis (C and N), as well as cell type-diagnosis interactions. Data were examined to determine false discovery rate and were filtered for fold changes in gene expression and p-value.	The molecular basis of breast cancer invasion and metastasis is not well understood.  Our objective was to analyze transcriptome differences between stromal and epithelial cells in normal breast tissue and invasive breast cancer to define the role stroma plays in invasion.  Total RNA was isolated from epithelial and stromal cells that were laser captured from normal breast tissue (n=5) and invasive breast cancer (n=28).  Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 GeneChips.  Differential gene expression was evaluated and compared within a model that accounted for cell type (epithelial [E] versus stromal [S]), diagnosis (cancer [C] versus normal [N]) as well as cell type-diagnosis interactions. Compared to NE, the CE transcriptome was highly enriched with genes in proliferative, motility and ECM ontologies.  Differences in CS and NS transcriptomes suggested that the ECM was being remodeled in invasive breast cancer, as genes were over-represented in ECM and proteolysis ontologies.   Genes more highly expressed in CS compared to CE were primarily ECM components or were involved in the remodeling of ECM, suggesting that ECM biosynthesis and remodeling were initiated in the tumor stromal compartment.; Keywords: cell type comparison, disease state analysis	GPL571	Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)	Transcriptomes of breast epithelium and stroma in normal reduction mammoplasty and invasive breast cancer patients.

GSE10281	Houston, TX, USA	Baylor College of Medicine	Public on Aug 15 2009	Mar 25 2019	Biopsies were taken from the same subjects both pretreatment and after 10-14 days Letrozol, 2.5 mg/day, oral.	Tumorigenic breast cancer cells characterized by high CD44 and low or undetectable CD24 levels (CD44+/CD24-/low) may be resistant to conventional therapies and responsible for cancer relapse. We defined a “signature” expression pattern of hundreds of genes associated with CD44+/CD24-/low, mammosphere-forming cells. In a panel of patient breast tumors, this tumorigenic gene signature was found exclusively manifested in tumors of the recently identified “claudin-low” molecular profile subtype characterized by overexpression of many mesenchymal-associated genes, suggesting that these tumors have pre-existing higher levels of tumorigenic cells. Furthermore, when comparing the expression profiles of paired breast cancer core biopsies before versus after hormone therapy or chemotherapy, both the tumorigenic and “claudin-low” signatures were more active in about half of tumors after treatment, indicative of a greater enrichment of tumorigenic cells as a result of treatments targeting the bulk tumor cells.; Keywords: two group comparison	GPL570	Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)	Letrozole (Femara) early response to treatment	Expression profiling by array

GSE96058	Lund, Sweden	Lund University	Public on Mar 12 2018	May 04 2022	Illumina paired-end RNA-sequencing and expression estimation were performed for two cohorts: a training cohort with 405 samples (GSE81538), and a validation cohort with 3273 samples (of which 136 cases have technical replicates) (GSE96058).  A comprehensive histopathological evaluation was performed on the 405-cohort to estimate inter-pathologist variability on original diagnostic slides as well as on repeat immunostains, leading to consensus scores for five clinical biomarkers.  Subtyping was performed using the PAM50 gene list.; Please note that there are ""primary sample"" (e.g F30) and ""technical replicate"" (e.g. F30repl) of the same BioSample.  The technical replicates in herein are primarily newly constructed and sequenced libraries from the same RNA extraction as the primary sample, with the remaining replicates being re-sequencings of the same library as the respective primary sample.; Due to the patient consent, Swedish law, the potential that the sequencing data contains personally-identifiable information and hereditary mutations, and the right to privacy, the submitter cannot make available the raw sequence data in a public repository.	PURPOSE; In early breast cancer (BC), five conventional biomarkers—estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), Ki67, and Nottingham histologic grade (NHG)—are used to determine prognosis and treatment. We aimed to develop classifiers for these biomarkers that were based on tumor mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), compare classification performance, and test whether such predictors could add value for risk stratification.; METHODS; In total, 3,678 patients with BC were studied. For 405 tumors, a comprehensive multi-rater histopathologic evaluation was performed. Using RNA-seq data, single-gene classifiers and multigene classifiers (MGCs) were trained on consensus histopathology labels. Trained classifiers were tested on a prospective population-based series of 3,273 BCs that included a median follow-up of 52 months (Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network—Breast [SCAN-B], ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02306096), and results were evaluated by agreement statistics and Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analyses.; RESULTS; Pathologist concordance was high for ER, PgR, and HER2 (average κ, 0.920, 0.891, and 0.899, respectively) but moderate for Ki67 and NHG (average κ, 0.734 and 0.581). Concordance between RNA-seq classifiers and histopathology for the independent cohort of 3,273 was similar to interpathologist concordance. Patients with discordant classifications, predicted as hormone responsive by histopathology but non–hormone responsive by MGC, had significantly inferior overall survival compared with patients who had concordant results. This extended to patients who received no adjuvant therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 3.19; 95% CI, 1.19 to 8.57), or endocrine therapy alone (HR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.55 to 4.51). For cases identified as hormone responsive by histopathology and who received endocrine therapy alone, the MGC hormone-responsive classifier remained significant after multivariable adjustment (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.39 to 4.34).; CONCLUSION; Classification error rates for RNA-seq–based classifiers for the five key BC biomarkers generally were equivalent to conventional histopathology. However, RNA-seq classifiers provided added clinical value in particular for tumors determined by histopathology to be hormone responsive but by RNA-seq to be hormone insensitive.
